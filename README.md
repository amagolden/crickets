# EnGauge (codename: crickets)

Poll for crowdsourcing employee questions 

## Description

Users can submit, view, and vote for their top questions. Polls are created and shared with teams ahead of an all-team or all-company meeting. Questions are ranked for leaders to address - driving transparancy & engagement within an organization.

## Dependencies

This is a frontend prototype built with React and Node.js. The prototype allows users to interact with the poll and vote on submissions. It does not allow users to create an account, save data, or create their own polls.
